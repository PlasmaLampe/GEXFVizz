# RGB color definition. Colors are refered to within configuration files
# by their name. In order to use a color, you must define it here. 
#
# Common colors (red, green, blue, etc) are already defined in 7
# tones, based on 7 color Brewer palettes, where available.
#
# vvlHUE (very very light HUE, e.g. vvlred)
# vlHUE (very light HUE, e.g. vlred)
# lHUE  (light HUE, e.g. red)
# HUE   (e.g. red)
# dHUE  (dark HUE, e.g. dred)
# vdHUE (very dark HUE, e.g. vdred))
# vvdHUE (very very dark HUE, e.g. vvdred))
#
# Boutique colors are not. If you really must use 'bisque', then add
#
# bisque = 255,228,196
#
# See colors.unixnames.txt for a large number of named color definitions.
#
# In addition to hues, two other color groups are defined. 
#
# - cytogenetic band colors (e.g. gposNNN, acen, stalk, etc.) which
#   correspond to colors on ideogram bands
# - UCSC chromosome color palette (e.g. chrNN, chrUn, chrNA)
#     - included from ucsc.conf
# 
# Another useful list of colors is in brewer.conf, which defines
# Brewer Palettes (www.colorbrewer.org), and corresponding lists.
